## Rule :bookmark:
1.There are 12 single numbered cards, and each card has only one number (1-12).

2.Add the numbers on the cards you get to get as close to 21 as possible, whoever is closest wins. The conditions for losing and winning are as follows:

  -If player has value > Bot player wins.

  -If the player has < value, the bot player loses.

  -If player always = Bot

  -If the value of both sides > 21, it is always considered.

3.In 1 Game, there will be n Rounds and in 1 Round there will be a maximum of 8 Turns (depending on the player's decision).

  - In 1 Round
    
    -Win = 1 point
        
     -Lose and Draw = 0 points
